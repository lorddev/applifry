          <h2>Itchy &amp; Scratchy</h2>

<p>They say open-source projects should always "scratch an itch." At 37signals, they built Basecamp as a product management tool for their own use. It is with a similar vision that we're building Applifry.</p>

<p>Our itch: how can we quantify feature requests in a democratic way that would basically take care of as much R&amp;D as possible before actually writing the first line of code for a new project?</p>

<p>GitHub's Issues feature is awesome. But wouldn't it be great if there were a way to really quantify the desirability of a feature before beginning development? Or if you wanted to create a new app and you needed to know how popular it would be?</p>

<p>Kickstarter is also awesome. But there's a little spot in the FAQ that makes it unusable for people like us. To paraphrase&mdash;&lsquo;Kickstarter is for projects that have a definite end and don't require maintenance. For example, we wouldn't have been able to use Kickstarter to build Kickstarter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In contrast, we <em>will</em> be using Applifry to build Applifry. Once the basic features are live, the remaining development will be utilizing the feature request functionality.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The aim of Applifry is to build a web-based community that would allow individuals or groups with app ideas to have them critiqued and scored and voted on by the community.</p>

<h3>Crowdsourcing + Gamification</h3>

<p>The easiest way I know to explain the vision of Applifry is to compare it to two very popular platforms: Stack Overflow and Kickstarter. Stack Overflow crowd-sources Q&amp;A; Kickstarter crowd-sources funding. Applifry will crowd-source R&amp;D.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow provides community accountability in that users are scored according to their usefulness to the community. The better answers you give, voted up by the community and/or selected as the answer, the better your score. As you get more points, you gain more privileges. This "gamification" aspect is expected to keep users active on the site.</p>

<p>It's also like Kickstarter in that it can be used to get ideas off the ground,  The more popular the idea is on the platform, the more successful its launch will likely be.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Anybody with an idea can submit a proposal. Community members can add comments which can then be converted into feature requests and upvoted by the community. The community can even vote whether they would be willing to pay money for such an app, and whether the app ought to be open-source. Eligible developer members (individuals or firms) could "bid" on projects once they have reached approval stage (determined by some scoring algorithm). (I put “bid” in quotes because their bid isn’t a monetary one, but a statement to the community as to why they ought to be picked to produce the product.)</p>

<p>(If the developer was the one who submitted the initial proposal, then the developer can choose to build the app him or herself.)</p>

<p>The benefit to developers who win a bid is two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>R&amp;D has already occurred via the community, and they have a reasonable expectation as to the popularity of the app.</li>
<li>If the community determined that the app would be something worth paying for, the developer would thereby have it as a source of revenue, and would also know the ideal pay point.</li>
</ol><p>As ideas are commented and ammended, selected text blocks could be highlighted and identified as feature numbers, and may or may not become a "requirement" for the product depending on how the community scores it. It's taking the organic frenzy of the spirit of open-source and wrapping it in a smooth UI where phrases can be measured and rated by the community rather than having to be deciphered by an individual PM and translated into a requirements doc. It's intended to be a more useful tool for the open-source development life cycle than mailing lists, forums, and IRC. We intend to also use the GitHub API, so that if the developer is hosting the project on GitHub, they can export the community-chosen features and requirements as GitHub issues. We could also allow use the GItHub API to import issues into Applifry.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the app will become like the next open-source Bugzilla or GetSatisfaction, in that every company with a website would in theory have a use for it. And the community would be a huge resource for individual developers looking for app ideas. This makes it an ideal candidate for open-source, as developers who may ask, “What's in it for me?” will find an answer in the product as a source of ideas and therefore revenue.</p>

<h3>Licensing notes:</h3>

<p>Note that once a developer has delivered a product whose idea was generated by the app community, that developer will retain all rights to the software (or he/she may choose to go open-source). But the account of the idea process will remain the property of the community, under GPL or CC license.</p>
